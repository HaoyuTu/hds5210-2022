# Notes on the Midterm

* _Correctness    (out of 40):_ 40
* _Good Practices (out of 10):_ 9
* _Docs / Testing (out of 10):_ 10

_Details on the grading criteria for the midterm can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.slu.edu/courses/28045/rubrics/23671)._



## Step 1
* Note where you are computing the mean inside the loops.  This will make python update your `new_avg_rate` every time you process an item. It only needs to be computed once, after you've read in all the items to your `new_list`

## Step 2
* Nice work. No comments.

## Step 3
* Rather than repeating all the code from `get_rate()` you should have just called `get_rate()`. I've deducted 1 point from _Good Practices_ for missing the reuse opportunity.

## Step 4
* Good work.
