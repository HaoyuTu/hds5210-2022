# Feedback on Final

I like how your project is organized. It made it easy to follow, even thought I couldn't undestand all of the column headers.  That wasn't a problem because of your documentation.

I would have liked to see your code more organized with use of functions that had documentation and test cases.  Use of functions makes your code more testable and verifiable along the way.  (-10 for Modularity / Style because no functions were defined)

Since you're looking for the relationship between "changes in salary and housing price/income ratio" and "population change," it would have been good to create a pivot table, correlation chart, or scatter plot to show that relationship.  I think what you wanted to show was "is salary correlated with population change?" and "is housing price / income ratio correlated with population change" -- population change being your indicator of "do people like Taiwan more or less now".
